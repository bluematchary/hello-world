just another repository - A tutorial about using GitHub : https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Hello GitHub!!
I had ever used Git system on GitLab and BitBucket services, but
I use them in private project. So I don't know how to treat "Pull requests","Issues","Marketplace", or more feature.
I wanna try to use them. :)
